# Text to Handwriting

This project is a fork of the [Text to Handwriting](https://github.com/saurabhdaware/text-to-handwriting) repository, aimed at generating handwritten text from typed input. It allows you to create beautiful, realistic handwritten text in a variety of styles. 

## Features

- Convert typed text into a handwriting-style image.
- Customize the handwriting style (font, color, etc.).
- Supports multiple font styles and various customization options.

## Usage

1. **Open** the [Text to handwriting](https://vasu-chaubey.github.io/text-to-handwriting-fork/) in your browser.
2. **Type** your desired text in the input field.
3. **Click** on "Generate image" to view the result.

> **Note**: This feature is still under development. Currently, it is set up for personal use, and more features will be added later.
